# Change Log

### v1.5

* Add option to include all recent sub comments in summary, not just removed ones
* Add ignore list for mods for "removed posts" list
* Add option to delay sending summary for all modmails, not just outgoing ones
* Add uptime alerting feature (for use by app developer only)

### v1.4

* Add option to increase number of posts shown in summary
* Fix issue with number of subs shown in participation history being incorrect
* Allow number of subs shown in participation history to be zero

### v1.3

* Add option to create summaries when making outgoing modmails. Previously these were always sent, but now it is configurable.

### v1.2

* Where the "Copy message after summary" is enabled, that output is now blockquoted to avoid inadvertent reports of the wrong modmail message resulting in Admin actions being taken against this app, not the OP
* Summaries are not created when receiving modmail from admins by default
* Escapes markdown properly in usernote output
* Further reliability and stability changes

### v1.1

* Add option to include recent subreddit posts from the user in the summary

### v1.0.4

* No functionality changes compared to previous releases, but improves reliability and stability, as well as reduces API resource usage. If you have had issues with the app not responding to new modmail posts, or posting summaries more than once, this release fixes those issues.
